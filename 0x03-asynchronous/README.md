# 0x03. Dart - Asynchronous

Asynchronous functions in Dart allow you to perform tasks concurrently without blocking the execution of other code. Dart provides built-in mechanisms for handling asynchronous operations, making it easy to work with tasks like fetching data from APIs, reading and writing files, or executing time-consuming computations.

In Dart, you can create asynchronous functions using the async and await keywords. Here's a brief description of the key concepts related to asynchronous functions in Dart:

async Keyword:

The async keyword is used to mark a function as asynchronous.
When a function is marked as async, it can use the await keyword to wait for asynchronous operations to complete without blocking the whole program.
An async function returns a Future, which represents a potential value or error that will be available in the future.
await Keyword:

The await keyword can only be used inside async functions.
It is used to pause the execution of the async function until the awaited operation completes.
The await expression returns the result of the completed Future or throws an exception if the Future completes with an error.
Future:

A Future represents a potential value or error that will be available at some point in the future.
It is used to handle asynchronous computations and operations that take time, such as network requests, file I/O, or timers.
You can use async functions and await to work with Future objects in a more synchronous style, making the code easier to read and maintain.
Error Handling:

Asynchronous functions can encounter errors, just like synchronous functions.
To handle errors in asynchronous functions, you can use try-catch blocks around the code containing await expressions.
If an error occurs during an await operation, the catch block will be executed, allowing you to handle the error gracefully.
Asynchronous functions are particularly useful in Flutter apps, where they help keep the UI responsive while performing potentially time-consuming tasks in the background. By using asynchronous functions, you can efficiently handle data loading, network requests, and any other asynchronous operations without blocking the main UI thread.

Keep in mind that when working with asynchronous functions, it's essential to handle errors appropriately to provide a smooth user experience and avoid crashes or unexpected behavior in your application.

Overall, Dart's support for asynchronous programming allows developers to build efficient and responsive applications by leveraging the power of concurrent execution and non-blocking operations.
