### The Dart project consists of multiple tasks that introduce fundamental concepts like basic output using print, string interpolation, handling numbers and doubles, string manipulations, assertions, and conditional statements. The tasks aim to build a solid foundation for understanding data types, control flow, and input handling in Dart programming.
