# 0x02. Dart - Classes

### In Dart, classes are a fundamental part of object-oriented programming (OOP). A class serves as a blueprint for creating objects, allowing developers to define properties (fields) and behavior (methods) associated with the objects. Classes provide a way to model real-world entities or abstract concepts in code, promoting code organization and reusability.

#### Properties and Fields:

Classes can have properties, also known as fields or instance variables. These properties represent the state or data associated with objects of the class. They define the characteristics or attributes of the objects.

#### Methods:

Methods are functions defined within a class. They define the behavior or actions that objects of the class can perform. Methods can access and manipulate the class's properties and can interact with other methods.

#### Constructors:

A constructor is a special method that is used to create and initialize objects of a class. It runs automatically when an object is instantiated. Constructors allow you to set initial values to the class's properties when creating objects.

#### Creating Objects:

To create an object of a class, you use the new keyword (optional in Dart 2.0 and later) followed by the class name and any required constructor arguments. This process is known as instantiation.

#### Encapsulation:

Classes in Dart support encapsulation, which means that they hide their internal details and expose only relevant data and methods to the outside world. This protects the class's data and ensures that it is accessed and modified only through the class's public interface.

#### Inheritance:

Dart supports inheritance, allowing classes to inherit properties and methods from other classes. This enables code reuse and promotes a hierarchical relationship between classes.

#### Polymorphism:

With polymorphism, you can use objects of different classes in a uniform way. It allows you to treat objects of derived classes as objects of their parent class, providing flexibility and extensibility.

#### Abstraction:

Abstraction in Dart refers to the process of defining the essential characteristics of an object and hiding the unnecessary details. Abstract classes and methods allow you to define a common interface that concrete classes can implement.
